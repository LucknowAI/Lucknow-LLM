Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh has two popular Buddhist temples. These are Buddha Dharmankur Sabha and Budh Vihar Temple on Risaldar Road. Of these, the former is the oldest temple dedicated to Lord Buddha. The Buddhist Temple in Lucknow was established by Bauddha Dharmankur Sabha in the year 1907 through the dedication and efforts of a monk called Bir Kripa Saran Bhikshu. Inside the temple you come across various statues of Lord Buddha seated against the background of Dharmachakra (Buddhist Wheel of Life). The atmosphere is as you would expect in any other Buddhist monastery, serene and calm. You can visit the monastery, pay respects and try meditating for some time if you feel like it.

The other temple dedicated to Lord Buddha is Buddha Vihar Temple at Risaldar Park. If you are looking for some tranquillity, then just make your way to this monastery. This monastery also has a historical significance because it was visited by Babasaheb Ambedkar twice during his lifetime. The main area of the temple, or the sanctum sanctorum, consists of a seated statue of Gautam Buddha. On the plinth there are various depictions of the followers of Lord Buddha. Behind the statue, there are several posters of the Buddha, each depicting him in a different way. To the right hand side of the statue stands the bust of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar for his tireless efforts to promote Buddhism among the deprived sections of the society. There is a moderately sized seating area for devotees and monks.
