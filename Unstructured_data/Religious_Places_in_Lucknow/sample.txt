FAMOUS GURUDWARA OF LUCKNOW

 Gurudwara Yahiyaganj, a holy place for followers of Sikhism.

From the outside, the structure of the temple looks quite small. The interiors of the gurudwara are surprisingly large. The atmosphere is as tranquil as you would expect in any other religious place. There is also a fascinating story behind its creation. It is believed that Guru Teg Bahadur (ninth of the ten Gurus in the Sikh religion), visited the city of Lucknow during 1670 and then stayed there for three days on his return from Patna Sahib (one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for Sikhs). This gurudwara was built in memory of that event. There is also an art gallery inside which displays various events related to the Sikh Panth.

To reach Gurudwara Yahiyaganj, you will have to first reach Lucknow. This city enjoys a good connectivity to cities located in close proximity, as well as the major cities of India, by train, air and road. Here is the best way of reaching it.

By Train: Lucknow Junction Railway Station is the major railway station in Lucknow. It operates trains to all the major cities. From the railway station, you can hire a taxi or any other private vehicle to reach Gurudwara Yahiyaganj, a drive which should not take you more than 14 minutes approx.

By Air: Lucknow has its own airport called Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport. It operates flights to all the major cities of India as well as those abroad. However, after arriving at the airport, you will find a lot of taxis and private vehicles for hire. From the airport, it should take you about 50 minutes to reach this place.

By Road: Lucknow enjoys a great road connectivity to the cities located in close proximity like Kanpur (86 km), Jhansi (316 km), Agra (323 km) and Varanasi (280 km). Kanpur and Jhansi are connected to Lucknow via NH27, while Varanasi is connected to it via NH 30. If you are coming to Lucknow from Agra, then you will have to take the Agra Lucknow Expressway.
