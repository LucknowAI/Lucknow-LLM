Christ Church Lucknow 


Although the Christ Church today paints a picture of tranquillity, it has had its fair share of turbulent history. There are many fascinating facts about it that make it a popular tourist attraction in Lucknow. One of them is that it is it was the first English church to be built in North India and the third in India. In fact, there was not a single church built between the years 1700 and 1819. Today, it intrigues onlookers and visitors with its elegant architecture, but also by the historical aura that pervades it. It is situated in the Hazratganj area. Although the church is not enormous in size, there is an old world feel to it that makes it special. However, you would not sense that until you actually enter its interiors and spend some time there. Visiting this church during your trip to Lucknow promises to be an informative and enlightening experience.
History
Before you read a short history of Christ Church, you should also know something about the other churches in the country. The first church built in India by the Britishers was at Madras in the year 1680. It was known as St. Mary's Church. This was followed by another church built in Kolkata in 1770 and known as St. John's Church. It was only in 1810 that a church was built in Lucknow, thus becoming the third city in India with a church. At that time however, this church was known as St. Mary's Church and it was built in the area known as British Residency.
Like many other parts of the country, the church did not go unscated during the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, also known as the First Struggle for India's Independence. It came under repeated attacks by the sepoys, with the worst attack carried out on 31st July and 5th August, 1857. It should be remembered however, that the attack was not motivated by any religious causes. It was attacked because the British used the church as a storage house for ammunition and weapons. Call it a stroke of luck or what you will, the church escaped being blown to smithereens by the British. During the next three years, while the church remained in a damaged state, the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and later the Sibtainabad Imambara served as places for Christian worship. Regular masses were also held at these religious places.
It is also interesting to know that for a short period of time, the gardens of the church were converted into a cemetery. The first people to be buried there were those that fell victims to the surprise attacks carried out by the Indian sepoys on 30th May, 1857.
Architecture
Christ Church is built in the Gothic style of architecture, just like most of the other churches across India. It is topped with twenty steeples, with a cross situated at the top of the entrance on the north. The church has an accommodation capacity of 130 persons at any given time. Observe its interiors though, and you will come across numerous marble tablets and polished brass plaques installed to honor the memory of British army officials, civilians and clergy who lost their lives in the conflict. These tablets are both a moving and impressive sight. One of the tablets is dedicated to James Grant Thomson, Deputy Commissioner of Muhamadee who lost his life fighting off the sepoys in Oudh on 5th June, 1857. Another of such tablets is dedicated to Revered Henry Polehampton. The church underwent extensive renovations and architectural modifications in 1904. The bell tower, which consists of a spire pointing towards the sky with a cross at the top, is a major eye turner.

The Lal Bagh Methodical Church in Lucknow, built in the Gothic style of architecture, with its pointed vault and ribbed faults, is a picture of elegance with simplicity. It was William Butler who began English services in Lucknow, with the congregation being formed in 1870. Until 1972, except for a brief period from 1942-1944, all the pastors of the church were foreigners. It was only in 1974 that Indians were appointed as pastors of the church. Today, there were over 300 members in the church, including children.
While there are other famous religious places to visit in Lucknow, you should visit this church for its historical significance and architecture, which combines grace with style. The altar faces the west direction while the main entrance door faces the eastern direction. The entrance has three doors, all of which are covered with a sloping portico. The northern part of the tower which faces out front is marked by a three storied tower.
The top portion of the tower is pointed and is mounted by a criss cross of steel. The middle portion of the roof is mounted by small crosses which present a lovely sight. Inside, facing the altar is a steel cross which is suspended in close proximity to the pulpit through a wire.

All Saints Garrison Church Lucknow 


Among the famous churches in India, or anywhere else in the world for that matter, have you ever heard of one which allowed people to carry weapons inside? All Saints Garrison Church, located in the Cantonment area of Lucknow, is one of them.
Before you jump to any conclusions, you should know how and why such a development came to take place, and the circumstances which led to it. As you enter the church, a sign greets you at the main door which reads, Whosoever thou art that enterest this church, leave it not without one Prayer to God for thyself, for those who minister, and for those who worship here.
It is a large impressive building to come across, one that is visible from quite a distance. At one point in time, it served as a church for those British residents who settled in the Cantonment area after escaping the British Residency when it was attacked by Indian sepoys. Even though it wears a forlorn look today, it does not fail to impress with its size and aesthetical elements. Stare at it from a distance for quite some time though, and you will feel a loneliness in the atmosphere, as if the church was yearning for the days gone by. Among the many churches to visit in Lucknow, this is one which you should not miss.
History
Though the All Saints Garrison Church impresses visitors with its size today, it wasn't always so. It was first built in 1860, and was considerably smaller in terms of its size and proportions then. As time passed, however, the Lucknow Cantonment (the new settlement of the British after they had escaped the Residency) grew in size, as did the number of troops. Naturally, the need for a larger church was felt.
After the construction of the new church was completed, it was named All Saints New Garrison Church. In fact, if you head towards the north west corner of the church about 15 to 20 feet away, you will come across a stone. The stone stands at the very same spot where the altar of the church was constructed in 1860.
The new church was built in 1908 by Jones Ransom, a British engineer who is also credited with having created the design for Saint Mungo's Church of Scotland in the Cantonment area of Lucknow. Although he had made considerable progress with the construction of the church, he had to leave it midway and return to England. The work was then completed by Lishman who was supervised by the notable architect John Baggs.
The most interesting part of its history though, is the decision to allow guns inside its premises. It is commonly believed that during the Revolt of 1857, the Indian sepoys had entered the premises to attack the British and as a result, many had lost their lives. To avoid that tragedy, people were permitted to carry weapons inside during prayers.
Architecture
In terms of architecture, the All Saints Garrison Church stands second to none. It is imposing, particularly its facade which is marked by an enormous tower. Even though the church was originally built by Jones Ransom, it underwent subsequent modifications under engineers who succeeded him. An example of this is the tower, which, in its original form, was meant to be taller than its present height. Another example is the side walls which were greatly reduced in both thickness and height, so as to save the overall expenses.
However, even though its construction was largely influenced by considerations of money and expenses, it still manages to retain its elegance. When it comes to the seating capacity though, this church has a larger seating capacity than any other church in Lucknow. Its large space is also visible in the quadrangle, which has seating areas made of ply.



It is the seating arrangements though, which strike the attention of the visitors and stand out as far as the architecture of the church is concerned. All the benches consist of a niche which was once used for keeping guns on the upper back side. This was done to enable the soldiers returning from their duties to participate in the prayers and other rituals while being in possession of their weapons.
