For that, the fort was used as a citadel to track the enemy operations. On the left and right side of Moti Mahal, there are two other monuments - Shah Manzil and Mubarak Manzil. These buildings along with the Moti Mahal were used by the Nawabs to watch animal fights and birds in flight that used to observe on the riverbank.

Heading:-Shahnajaf Imambara Lucknow 

Near Sikandrabad, on the bank of Gomti River, there is located a mausoleum - Shahnajaf Imambara that was built in the 19th century. It was the first king of Awadh clan - Ghazi-ud-Din Haider, who constructed this historical site in Lucknow. He built the Imambara as a token of his devotion to Hazrat Ali, who was the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad. Shahnajaf Imambara is a replica of Ghazi-ud-Din’s own tomb in Iraq. At present, Shahnajaf Imambara is one of the main tourist attractions in Lucknow mainly because of its historical significance and impressive architecture. Near the Imambara, a house and a mosque for Mumtaz Mahal (his wife) were also constructed by Ghazi-ud-Din Haider. However, in the year 1913, the house was torn down to construct a road on the riverside. Inside the Imambara, there lie the remains of him as he wanted to be buried here. Along with that, the graves of his wives Mubarak Mahal, who died in 1849, Sarfaraz Mahal who died in 1878, and Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1896. On 13th of Rajab (birthday of Hazrat Ali) and between 7th and 9th Muharram, the Imambara is beautifully decorated.
History
Constructed in the year 1816 - 1817, Shahnajaf Imambara is the mausoleum of Haider Ali and his three wives. However, the aim to build this Imambara was to create a place for Azadari (mourning for the sacrifice of Imam Hussain).
Architecture
Coming on to the architecture of this popular tourist place in Lucknow, the Imambara boasts a strong influence of Mughal architectural style. However, the highlight of the architecture of this Imambara is the large dome which is unique in its shape. Unlike other domes, the neck of the dome is not slender but is onion-shaped. Along with that, there is also a doorway at both front and back side of the Imambara.

Heading:-Charbagh Railway Station Lucknow 

There are very few cities in India whose railway stations are themselves major tourist attractions. The Charbagh Railway Station located in Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh, is one of them. This enormous structure of red and white, with its turrets, domes and towers, is an impressive sight, and another reminder of glorious heritage in Lucknow. There is no pretension of modesty about it, with its grand proportions overseeing the onlooker at first sight.
This railway station, which is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places to visit in Lucknow, is called Char Bagh (four gardens) because of the four gardens which are believed to have existed here till 1867. Of them, one garden still exists today, and is located just across the railway station. Spacious and large, the park complements the beauty of the railway station significantly.
History
The foundations for the Charbagh Railway Station was laid on 21st March, 1914 by Bishop George Herbert, with its design planned by J.H. Hornimen. However, it took 9 years for the construction of the railway station to be completed in 1923. The entire investment for the structure was about 70 lakh rupees. C.L.Colvin, a famous agent of the British East India Company, placed a casket inside the turret of the building which contained a coin and newspaper of those times. It was meant to serve as a reminder of the successful completion of the building. Today, an old railway engine stands at the exit gate of the railway station, transporting us back to the days of steam engines.
The Charbagh Railway Station in Lucknow has also witnessed some memorable episodes of Indian history. It was here that Mahatma Gandhi first met Jawaharlal Nehru and participated in the opening session of the legislature of Congress. This railway station was once again graced by the noble presence of Gandhiji when he attended yet another session of the Congress legislature held here.
Architecture
The Charbagh Railway Station is one of the most beautiful railway stations in India. Its architectural style suggests a combination of various styles including Mughal, Rajput and Awadhi. Another interesting fact about this railway station is that when viewed aerially, it resembles a chess board, with the domes, pillars and turrets appearing like chess pieces on a board. There are various tunnels below the station which are today used for the purpose of transporting goods. It is also believed that if you stand on the porch of the station, you will not hear the noise of incoming and outgoing trains. The basic structure of the station complex is rectangular in shape, with the raised platforms being used for official purposes.

Heading:-The Residency Lucknow 

Once the residence for the British Resident General and now a popular tourist landmark in the Lucknow city, is The Residency. Also touted as the Residency Complex and British Residency, it is basically a group of buildings in one enclosure. Overlooking the River Gomti, this historical site in Lucknow is engirdled by gorgeous gardens and lawns. On a whole, the Residency is an architectural marvel in the city of Lucknow. One of the most interesting things to know about the Residency is that it has been a significant part of the Seige of Lucknow (1857); the ruins of which can still be seen at the site. The front gate of the complex was referred to as the Baillie guard gate. The name of this gateway was kept after Col. John, the first resident of the British Residency. However, in the initial days of this complex, there was a practice of Guard of Honour that was started by the Nawab of that time. Besides the gate, there lie the ruins of The Treasury. Though this part was used to serve as a warehouse of wretched cartridges during the war of 1857, yet, it is one of the main features of this popular tourist attraction in Lucknow.On one of the walls of the complex, a marble plaque is inscribed that honours the troops that fought with bravery. This memorial is believed to be built later unlike the other parts of the building, since it is intact. The Residency complex houses graves of around 2000 soldiers that sacrificed their lives during the war of 1857. 
At present, this famous heritage attraction in Lucknow is serving as a government office. It also includes a museum along with the tomb of Saadat Ali Khan - the first Nawab of Awadh. Within the complex, Kaisarbagh Palace and an observatory are two more key features. Apart from this, the building complex also includes a mosque, Imambara, a brigade mess, Ommaney’s house, judicial post, Anderson’s post and Sago’s house.
History
The construction of the Residency was started in the late 1700s by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daulah, however, it was completed by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. After a few years of the construction, it became British personnels’ hub. In the initial years, they were just the delegates of the East India Company. However, as the reign of British East India expanded, the city of Lucknow became their administrative centre, and as an effect of that, the Residency also came under the British commissioner of Awadh. The biggest event that this place has been a part of, is the first war of Independence which held in the year 1857. One of the main centres of this entire siege was Lucknow and the main target was The Residency. Cannons and bullets destroyed the major part of this place and even today, the traces of that revolt can still be seen at The Residency.
Entry Fee
The entry fee to The Residency varies for both Indian and foreign tourists.

For Indians: The entry fee is 5 INR per head
For Foreigners: The entry fee is 100 INR per head




Architecture
The Residency is a set of buildings that are enclosed in a large compound. It includes armoury, quarters, stables, worship places, residential quarters, dispensaries and so on. However, one of the key features of this must-visit place in Lucknow is the Banquet Hall that was also built by the Nawab. The hall boasts the intricate carvings of tall arches along with high ceilings and large hallways. At the back, there is open space which was used as the kitchen in that era. Coming on to the entrance of the Residency, there is a beautiful fountain in the centre that perfectly complements the beauty of the place. Nearby the banquet hall, there is located the house of Dr Frayer that also served as the hideout for the British families during the revolt of 1857. The house has a basement which is said to be used as a hiding place for the children and women. However, during the war, the house was often used as the hospital. Above all that, the main building is the must-see thing at the Residency. It was once the imposing three-storey building that used to have a library, games room and offices. Besides, at the front of the main building, there is located a large memorial cross which was built for MG Sir John Inglis along with his wife Julia. He died in the siege of Lucknow.
Location Address
Mahatma Gandhi Marg, Deep Manak Nagar, Qaiserbagh, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226001, India.

Heading:-Dilkusha Kothi Lucknow 

Even though much of Dilkusha Kothi lies in ruins today, it still exudes that stately aura which suggests it being a structure of immense historical and cultural significance. It has witnessed some of the most thrilling episodes of Indian history. History lovers or not, this is a monument which you should visit during your trip to Lucknow. This monument was built in the 18th century by Major Gore Ouseley, the British resident and a good friend to the then ruler of Oudh, Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. It was initially built as a hunting lodge for the Nawabs, although it also served the function of a summer resort. Because of its close proximity to the river, the Dilkusha Kothi, which still is one of the popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, was also used as a place where the Begums (wives of Nawabs) came to relax, unwind and enjoy a picnic. It is interesting to note however, that this place did not have a separate zenana (ladies’ room), a feature common to all Nawabi buildings. 
This structure has fascinated people from all over the globe since the earliest times. It was from this place that William Howard Russell, an acclaimed correspondent of The Times, said that Lucknow was the most beautiful city he had ever come across, adding that its beauty exceeded that of Rome, Athens and Constantinople. And this, at a time when the building was damaged by the exchange of heavy artillery fire between the Indian sepoys and the British forces during the Indian Revolt of 1857. This magnificent structure also charmed Mary Linley Taylor, a famous British actress, who was so impressed by it that she named her home in Seoul after it. 
The building went further changes under the rule of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (the tenth and last Nawab of Awadh). It was he who, during the early years of his rule, built another Kothi just next to it. This was done so that he could hold military exercises for his troops. However, the British were very offended by this act and ordered him to stop all further exercises. This left the Nawab quite helpless and frustrated. It was not too later that he was forced to abdicate by the British. Before doing so, he also refused to sign his abdication statement, following which, he was illegally deposed. 
Upon visiting the Dilkusha Kothi today, you can but be moved by the sight of it and the events which occurred at this very spot. It is as if the structure bemoans a loss of lost lives and the sacrifices made. An emptiness pervades the atmosphere, and in the midst of it all, you are overcome by nostalgia.
Architecture
Much of the Dilkusha Kothi is in ruins today. However, take a quick look at its walls and towers, and you are instantly reminded of its grand past. The design of this structure bears a striking resemblance to Seaton Delaval Hall, an amazing country house located in Northumberland, England. 
This 18th century house was originally a three-storeyed structure which also housed a mini-basement. There were four ornamental octagonal towers whose entrance was marked by an impressive flight of steps. These then led to a central doorway which rested on tall pillars which are as high as the roof of the second storey. Another notable feature of the structure which lent it a similarity to Claude Martin, was the presence of female statues near the balustrades. The perfectly manicured gardens outside the Kothi greatly add to its beauty.

Heading:-Sikandar Bagh Lucknow 

Today, it is difficult to believe that Sikandar Bagh, one of the most popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, was the site of a fierce battle between the British and Indian forces. At one point of time, though, it was a cultural center, hosting plays, music, dances and poet competitions throughout the year. Visit it in the morning, and you come across people of all ages enjoying a leisurely walk, playing games or just spending some quiet time.
Sikandar Bagh is spread over an area of 120 square yards and was built by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Oudh, as his summer residence. According to some people, it was named Sikandar after Alexander the Great, while others say that it was named after Sikandar Mahal Begum, the favourite wife of the Nawab. Even after the raids and attacks conducted on it, it exudes a kind of magnificence which is to be found in all such structures dating back to that era. This garden is a part of the National Botanical Research Institute.
History
During the Indian Revolt of 1857, Sikandar Bagh served as a major stronghold for the Indian troops during their siege of the British Residency in Lucknow. The fierce battle which occurred here claimed more than two thousand lives. A particularly notable incident is worth mentioning in this regard because it sheds light on the exemplary bravery displayed by the women soldiers of Begum Hazrat Mahal. The entire scene was described by an eyewitness who went by the name of Sergeant William Forbes Mitchell. He says that there was an enormous peepal tree in the garden, beneath which there were water jars placed for the soldiers to quench their thirst.
After one such episode of fighting, the Sergeant noticed the scattered bodies of English soldiers at a particular spot. Having examined the wounds, he reached the conclusion that every one of these soldiers had been shot from above. He ordered a soldier by the name of Wallace to see if anybody was lodged in that tree. Sure enough, he spotted a person and fired. The body landed on the ground with a loud thud, and upon discovering that it was a woman, was immediately filled with remorse. What he said next reflected the immense grief that he was immersed in, "If I had known it was a woman, I would rather have died a thousand deaths than have harmed her".
Although the identity of the woman was never ascertained, there was a monument built in her memory. A bust with the name of “unknown heroine” is located inside the premises of the park and reminds visitors of the supreme sacrifice and valour displayed by her. Here is another interesting fact associated with the monument. A year after the Sikandar Bagh was stormed, an Italian-British photographer by the name of Felice Beato captured the recently damaged structure in her photograph. Looking at the photo, one can well imagine the intensity of the fighting which occurred here, while its overall charm is enhanced by the fact that it was shot almost two hundred years back.
Architecture
Sikandar Bagh is located in close proximity to the National Botanical Research Institute, another famous tourist attraction in Lucknow. The entire structure was built at a cost of approximately 5 lakh rupees. It was once home to a summer palace along with a wooden pavilion. At one point of time, it also housed a mosque inside an enclosure which had huge walls and three lofty gateways on three sides. Today, however, only one of the structures stand, as the rest were completely razed to the ground during the Indian Revolt of 1857.



This gateway is a major attraction inside the Sikandar Bagh, which is one of the most beautiful structures you should visit in Lucknow. It reflects a combination of various architectural styles, from Indian and Persian to European and Chinese. Its interiors are adorned with lovely frescoes which bear a close resemblance to the Chikan embroidery style that Lucknow is famous for. Exquisite examples of art can also be witnessed on the chattris and pagodas. The entire monument is protected by the Archaeological Survey of India and therefore, is of great national importance.

Heading:-La Martiniere Lucknow 

La Martiniere is one of the premier educational institutes in not only in Lucknow but in the country. Its alumni consist of individuals who have achieved excellence in their respective fields and done the country proud time and again. In fact, it is one of the few educational institutions in India which has been depicted on postage stamps. On 1st October, 1955, Dr. Shankar Dayal Sharma, on the occasion of the school’s 150th anniversary, issued a postage stamp in its honour. It is a reflection of the high esteem in which the school was held during those years, and still is today. On your next trip to Lucknow, this is one of the tourist attractions which you should visit as it is an essential part of the city’s heritage.
History
The history of La Martiniere in Lucknow is quite interesting. The school was founded in 1845 according to the will of Major General Claude Martin. He was born in Lyon in France in 1735 but died in 1800 AD in Lucknow. According to the instructions issued by him, the day of his death was to be celebrated as Founder’s Day. In his will, he also allotted some funds for the establishments of schools in France, Kolkata and Lucknow.
There is another development associated with the school which makes it unique among the other schools in independent India or the erstwhile British Empire. After the death of Claude Martin, his will was the subject of great litigation. The seriousness of the matter required the intervention of the then Supreme Court of Calcutta. The court declared on 11th April, 1839, that a college in Lucknow be established according to his will. Another decree issued by the Supreme Court on 22nd December 1841, led to the setting up of a scheme for the establishment of the college in Lucknow. This is how the college came into existence.
The Indian Revolt of 1857 also had an impact on La Martiniere. Concerned with the rapidly deteriorating situation, the college was shifted to the Residency on 13th June 1857. This was done on the orders of Sir Henry Lawrence. During the attacks by Indian troops, the principal, masters and boys of La Martiniere defended the southern perimeter of the Residency, which was exposed and thus, vulnerable to attacks from outside. They braved hardships and courageously defended The Martiniere Post for five months, while ensuring that they were regular with their studies. Their brave spirits and the exemplary courage shown by them during trying times was acknowledged in 1938 when the college was awarded colors which bore the legendary Defense of Lucknow. Never before, or after, has a school been honored in this way.
Architecture
The school’s infrastructure is a matter of pride, as are its traditions and heritage. Indeed, one is incomplete without the other. La Martiniere boasts two academic campuses, the Junior School Campus and Constantia Campus. The Junior School Campus consists of three academic blocks which houses the pre-school and junior sections. Constantia Campus, on the other hand, houses the middle and senior sections of the school. The accommodations for resident scholars and resident staff are also housed in this part. The construction of the building known as Constantia began in 1796. Although it is not protected by the Archaeological Survey of India, it is a part of the Lucknow Heritage Zone. The founder of the college is buried in the crypt in the basement, while directly above the crypt stands the La Martiniere Memorial Hall. The bust of the Founder, which is an impressive sight in itself, is surrounded by tablets which display the names of the former students who attained martyrdom in Second World War. In their honor, the college was presented by blue and gold battle honors, which are now part of the College Flag.
A feature common to all La Martiniere schools across India is the Chapel. The chapel of this college is over a century old. A special feature about the chapel are the two stained glass windows which were presented as a gift by two former students of the college. They depict child Jesus in the Carpenter’s shop along with the doctors of law, emphasizing the importance of honest manual labour along with wisdom.
Another attractive part of the College’s architecture is its east terrace, which is accessed by a grand staircase. It is an artificial lake and from its center juts out a solid fluted column which is almost 125 ft high. Called the Lat, it is associated with several legends as well as theories revolving around its existence. The center of the east terrace is occupied by an enormous canon used in the Battle of Seringapatam in 1792.



There is also a special bell placed on a pedestal. The east terrace also hosts several occasions, including parades and Prize Day. Each step of the stones have been engraved with the names of pupils who have, through the centuries, left their lasting impression in one way or the other.Other notable buildings in the college complex are swimming baths, college hospitals, tombs of Boulone and Major Hudson.

Heading:-Bara Imambara Lucknow 

Mughal Emperors and their deputies, the Nawabs, had their own ways of solving problems. The Bara Imambara, for example, was constructed to tackle the onset of one such famine. Built by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula between the years 1785 and 1791 AD, the main objective behind building it was to provide employment to the people. There are several interesting tales associated with this structure, which is undeniably one of the most beautiful heritage attractions in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. According to one of those, common people worked during the day to build up its base, while noblemen and other members of the elite class demolished anything which was built during the night! The purpose behind this was to extend the duration of the work as much as possible, or at least, as long as the famine lasted.
What we call Bara Imambara is a large mosque complex whose main portion is an enormous hall, apart from the Asfi mosque and Baoli. It houses the graves of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula and his wife Shamsunnisa Begum. Here, Muslims perform their sacred rituals during the Muharram festival, also known as Azadari in the local language. On this day, Muslims mourn the death of Husayn ibn Ali in the battle of Karbala.
As a visitor, you will find many things to admire in the Imambara. However, one particular part of it that will catch your fancy is the Bhool Bhulaiya. It is a labyrinth of interconnected passages and doors which seem to lead into a series of passages. Take care not to venture too deep inside the passageways, though. Stories of people wandering deep into the passageways, never to be found again, are quite common. Some of these passageways lead you into the ceiling from where you can enjoy the spectacular views on the outside. Although most of them have been closed, the safest way of exploring these passageways is through an authorised guide.
There are other attractions inside the mosque complex which promise to keep you engaged throughout the duration of your visit. Other than the Bhool Bhulaiya, there is the stepwell (baoli) and the Asfi mosque that attracts visitors. An interesting fact about the mosque is that it was built without the use of iron by taking the assistance of European experts who were specially called for the purpose.
Architecture
The Bara Imambara is built in the combination of Mughal, Rajput and Gothic architectural styles. Designed by Hafiz Kifayat Ullah, an extremely renowned architect of that time, it is an example of sheer engineering marvel and has no parallel.
Inside the monument, there are 9 halls in all, out of which, the central hall is the largest. It is the ceiling which deserves a special mention. Standing at a height of almost 15m, it is supported without any columns, iron rods, beams or girders. This was done because the central hall was to be used as a place for prayers. It is undoubtedly the largest unarched hall in the world.
The monument itself is built of Lakhauri bricks which are laid in lime mortar. It is adorned with stucco work along with chattris and parapets. The interior matches, perhaps even exceeds, the exterior, in terms of splendour. Chandeliers, alam, tazias have been used in its decoration. The absence of wood or metal is also very impressive. On all fronts, the Bara Imambara reflects perfection and grandeur in its architecture.



Interesting Facts

The main hall, or the Central Hall of the Bara Imambara, is the largest unarched hall in the world.
Many interconnected passages of the Bhool Bhulaiya were closed to the general public after some people were reported missing.
It is believed that there are secret tunnels in the Bara Imambara which lead directly to the Gomti River, Delhi, Faizabad and Allahabad.

Entry Fee
The entry fee for Bara Imambara varies for both domestic and international tourists. For domestic tourists, the entrance fee is 25 INR, while the fee for international tourists is 500 INR.
Best Time to Visit
Bara Imambara is located in Lucknow, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. You can visit it throughout the year, depending on your preferences.

Heading:-Colonial Monuments Lucknow

The first contact that British had with Uttar Pradesh was during the rule of the third Nawab of Awadh. Under the British rule, the state that we called Uttar Pradesh was referred to as United Provinces. The important role that this region played in the establishment and expansion of British rule in India is only too well documented.
All throughout that role, the British built some magnificent structures. Inspired by the traditional neoclassical and Gothic styles of architecture, they stand in stark contrast to the rest of the monuments and structures existing around the state today. The pointed arches in the churches and government buildings for example, are completely different from the bulbous shaped domes which were an essential feature of buildings built during both Mughal and Nawab era.
As a tourist, it is not difficult to spot the colonial monuments in Uttar Pradesh, as part of your heritage tours. As with other styles of architecture which arrived to India from abroad and then fused with the traditional style of the region, the purely European design also blended with the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. In common parlance, this is also referred to as Indo-Saracenic architecture. You can observe this style of architecture in Uttar Pradesh in the churches, educational institutions (government schools and colleges), palaces, residential quarters and government buildings.
It should be remembered that the colonial era buildings in Uttar Pradesh are not limited to any particular region, city or town. They are distributed all over the state. For example, in Allahabad, the most popular colonial monuments are the Allahabad High Court and the University of Allahabad. Along with these structures, there also stands the All Saints Cathedral. Known in the local language as “Patthar Girjaghar”, it can be easily said that it is one of the most beautiful Anglican cathedrals in all of Asia. It was designed by Sir William Emerson in the 13th century in the Gothic style of architecture.
Other colonial monuments which are great heritage tourist attractions in Uttar Pradesh are the Mayo Memorial Hall. Built in 1879 by R. Roskell Bayne in memory of the assassinated Viceroy Mayo, its main attraction is a 180 ft high tower. This hall was built with the purpose of hosting balls, receptions and public meetings.
From Allahabad, the journey of exploring the most famous colonial monuments in Uttar Pradesh takes us to Varanasi. Here, the most popular of colonial era structures is the Sanskrit College. What makes this college special is the fact that it was one of the earliest colleges built by the British East India Company in India.
Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, famous for its culture (fondly referred to as “tehzeeb”), traditions and customs, is also home to several colonial monuments which were built under the British rule. One of these is the Raj Bhavan, which was earlier known as Kothi Hayat Baksh. It was designed by Major General Claude Martin and served as his residence. He chose Lucknow as his permanent place of residence because he was very impressed with its culture, mannerisms and traditions. Prior to independence, it served as the official residence of the Governor of United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. It came to be known as Raj Bhavan only after India’s independence. Another colonial era building in Lucknow which is fascinating to visit as a tourist is the Lucknow GPO, or the post office, as it is simply known. It is quite interesting to know that this same building was once a ring theatre visited by British families for purposes of fun and recreation. The screening of British dramas and films were a regular affair. How time changes, and with it, everything that it stands for! Thoughts like these engulf you as you explore the various colonial era buildings in Uttar Pradesh. Lucknow is also home to other colonial era buildings which were built during the colonial era like The Residency, Dilkusha Palace, La Martiniere School and Lalbagh Methodist Churches, among others. 
One other place where you can visit the colonial era monuments during your heritage tour in Uttar Pradesh is Meerut. This place is famous for being the first center of uprising during the Indian Revolt of 1857. Some of the colonial era monuments which you can explore in Meerut are Begum Samru Church in Sardhana and Basilica of Our Lady of Graces. This church was built by Begum Samru and is one of the largest Roman Catholic Churches in North India. The design of the church is inspired by the St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and is constructed in pure white marble. It truly is a picture of tranquility and elegance.
Architecture
All the colonial monuments which exist in UP today were built when it was under British rule. Undoubtedly, there is an overwhelming influence of European style of architecture, ie, neoclassicism and Gothic styles. That is evident by features such as the pointed vault and flying buttress.
As you explore the colonial monuments of UP, however, you should remember that they represent a combination of Indo-Islamic and European styles of architecture. This is a combination which one rarely comes across. For example, while the All Saints Cathedral is designed in the purely Gothic style of architecture, the Allahabad High Court and University of Allahabad are a combination of Indian and Western styles of architecture.  A structure like the Basilica of Our Lady of Graces displays an overwhelming influence of Italian with Indian styles of architecture.



Another quite different sight awaits you at the district of Dilkusha in Lucknow. Here, the Dilkusha Palace, built by Nawab Saadat Ali Khan, derives its inspiration from an English country house called Seaton Delaval in Northumberland, which was built in 1721. Another Gothic style architecture is the Lalbagh English Methodist Church which is built in purely Gothic style of architecture.
Interesting Facts

Many of the colonial era monuments in UP, particularly in Allahabad, are finest examples of European styles of architecture.
A structure like the All Saints Cathedral is believed to be one of the finest Anglican cathedrals in Asia.
The Roman Catholic Church of Sardhana was honored by Pope John XXIII. It was he who accorded it the status of a minor Basilica in 1961.

Entry Fee
The entry fee to the colonial monuments in UP depends on the monument you happen to be visiting. For visiting the Allahabad High Court require you to obtain a visitor’s pass, which is available at a nominal fee. Visiting the All Saints’ Cathedral does not require you to pay an entry fee. For visiting Dilkusha Kothi Palace, domestic tourists have to pay 5 INR, while international tourists have to pay 100 INR. For visiting churches, you don’t have to pay any entry fee, while visiting colonial monuments now serving as government offices will require you to do so.
Best Time to Visit
Most of the monuments built during the colonial era are located in the cities of Allahabad, Lucknow and Meerut. These cities tend to get quite hot during the summers, with temperatures averaging between 40°C to 43°C. If the heat doesn’t bother you much though, you can plan a trip to these colonial monuments in UP during the summers. In winters, though, the weather becomes cool and pleasant. It creates the perfect conditions for sightseeing and exploration, thus letting you have a great time. If you prefer cool weather, plan a trip during the winters.

Heading:-Rumi Darwaza Lucknow 

The Rumi Darwaza (Gate) is an incredible structure which stands imposingly between Bara Imambara and Chota Imambara in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. Constructed in 1784 under the rule of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, it is a fine example of Awadhi architecture, or the Lucknow School of Architecture. It was a style adopted by the Nawabs of Awadh to preserve the Mughal architectural style while experimenting with newer styles and materials.
The Rumi Darwaza, one of the heritage attractions in Uttar Pradesh, is also referred to as Turkish Gate because it bears a strong similarity in design to a gateway built in ancient Constantinople (today’s Turkey) called Bab-i-Humayun. Standing at an impressive height of 60ft, it once served as the entrance to Old Lucknow City. Today however, you find the gate looking on as auto rickshaws, bicycles and vehicles speed along underneath it. If you think this gateway looks beautiful during the daytime, wait till you see it illuminated during the evening when its beauty puts on a new face.
Architecture
The Rumi Gate is an amazing piece of architecture, and is always included in any heritage tours. Standing at 60 ft, it has become the symbol of the city. While the Nawab School of Architecture seeks to preserve the Mughal architectural style, the materials used and the design itself vary in great degrees. For example, the majority of Mughal monuments were built using red sandstone, while bricks are the primary material used its construction along with a coating of lime. This is also one of the reasons behind the intricate detailing on this structure.
One of the most popular tourist attractions of India, Rumi Darwaza is adorned with wonderfully carved flowers and designs. The uppermost part of the structure is topped with a chhatri (umbrella) which can be reached through a staircase (although it’s not open to visitors at present). It is interesting to know that at one point of time, there was a lantern at the top of the structure. In addition, the exquisitely carved flower buds situated on the sides of the arch would release little jets of water. Now that would have been a sight to come across.
Entry Fee
Rumi Darwaza is a gateway located on the road, hence, there are no entry fees to visit it. Anybody can visit it free of charge.



Interesting Facts

Rumi Darwaza is in no way related to the poet Rumi. It is so called because it was modelled after a similar gateway in Istanbul, which was then known as Constantinople under the Eastern Roman Empire.
The construction of this structure was started by the Nawab as part of the Food for Work programme at a time when this region was suffering from famine.
George Russell, who worked as a reporter for the New York Times in mid-19th century, called the stretch of road from Rumi Darwaza to Chattar Manzil as the most incredible landscape he had ever come across.

Best Time to Visit
Rumi Darwaza can be visited anytime of the year.

Heading:-Chhota Imambara Lucknow 

With a stunning white Mughal architecture adorned with a golden dome on the top and exquisite calligraphy on its exterior, Chhota Imambara is one of the top tourist attractions in Lucknow. Also known as Hussainabad Imambara, this marvelous structure is basically a congregation hall which was erected in the year 1838 for Shia Muslims by the Nawab of Awadh - Muhammad Ali Shah. Located in the west (some 2 km) of Asafi Imambara, this popular historical landmark in Lucknow also serves as the resting place of Muhammad Ali Shah and his mother. The Imamabara boasts an exquisite construction which is beautifully adorned with several turrets, gilded dome, and chandeliers.

The other hall is Azakhana which is ornamented with stunning glass lamps and chandeliers. It is believed that these chandeliers were brought from Belgium. The Tomb of Princess Zinat Algiya is another highlight of this historical tourist place in Lucknow. There are also graves of Muhammad Shah Ali’s son, his two sons-in-law, and his wife. The tomb is said to be the replica of Taj Mahal. Satkhanda is another major structure of the imposing Imambara. It is a watchtower which was supposed to be of seven stories but during the 4th storey construction of this tower, Muhammad Shah Ali died.



 As a result of that, the watchtower was left abandoned which can still be seen. It was the desire of Nawab to make it a replica of Leaning Tower of Pisa and Qutub Minar of Delhi.

There are three structures in the park; two of them are enclosed tombs. One of the tombs contains the remains of Ibrahim Chishti.

Heading:-Tombs of Saadat Ali Khan & Khurshid Zadi Lucknow 

The tombs of Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi are grand in their own right, and visiting them can be a delightful experience. Both these tombs, which are one of the popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, are known for their intricate architecture and the garden surrounding them.  Located in close proximity to the Begum Hazrat Mahal Park (built in 1962 to commemorate her contribution to the revolt of 1857), the tomb houses the 5th Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, and his wife, Khurshid Zadi. She was the favourite wife of the Nawab and died during his lifetime. Saadat Ali Khan was the ruler of Awadh from 1794-1814 AD, and many of the heritage buildings dotting the area between Qaisar Bagh and Dilkusha can be credited to him. During this time, the British ruled large parts of Lucknow and were becoming more powerful with each passing day. It is quite easy to overlook this wonderful memorial amidst other heritage buildings in the city like Chota Imambara and Bara Imambara. However, it is only upon visiting the tombs that you find out what you were missing out on. 
Architecture
The tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi are counted among the best places to visit in Lucknow. Their architecture has a lot to do with that. While its facade is decorated with lime plaster, the walls are built using Lakhuri bricks (red colored burnt clay bricks) while sandstone has been used for the floors. Upon entering the tomb, you come across rectangular verandahs with intricately carved arched doorways. Of these, those on the southern and eastern side contain the graves of the daughters and wives of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. The floor of the tomb has also been given an elegant look, thanks to the black and white marble tiles laid out in a chess like pattern. Among the other features of the tomb, its hemispherical dome deserves a special mention. It attracts the attention of the onlookers with its symmetrical shape and is topped by an inverted lotus and a finial. In the center of the hall, there is an elegant rectangular design which marks the exact place where the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan rests. Head towards the basement and you come across three graves, one of the Nawab and the other two of his brothers. 
The tomb of Khurshid Zadi is located to the east of the Nawab’s tomb. Although it is a four level structure, the graves of the mother and daughter rest at the lowest level. On the corners of the domes are octagonal shaped chhatris, which embellish its beauty. The tombs, which make for great sightseeing in Lucknow, are surrounded by beautiful gardens and are great for enjoying some moments of peace and solitude.

Heading:-Vidhan Bhawan Lucknow 

Lucknow is dotted with structures from the Mughal, Nawab and British era. Of these, the last stands out from the other due to the marked difference in the style of architecture. Vidhan Bhawan (state assembly), the seat of bicameral legislature in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the finest examples of Indo-European architecture with an overwhelming influence of Gothic elements. When viewed from a distance, this one of the top places to see in Lucknow looks akin to a palace. On national events like Independence Day and Republic Day, this historical site in Lucknow is bedecked with lights, and its beauty is enhanced manifold.
History
Allahabad, or what is today known as Prayagraj, was the capital of the state of Uttar Pradesh till the early 20th century. In 1922, a decision was taken to shift the capital to Lucknow. It was on December 15, 1922 that the then Governor, Sir Spencer Harcourt Butler, laid the foundation stone of Vidhan Bhawan, then known as the Council House. The design of the building was conceived by two eminent architects of the time, Sir Swinton Jacob and Shri Heera Singh. The total expenditure of the building was estimated to be 21 lakh rupees, a tremendous amount of money at that time. It took about five years to complete its construction. The magnificence of the building perfectly reflects this exorbitant amount spent on its construction.
Architecture
It can hardly be argued that the Vidhan Bhawan is an example of magnificent Indo-European architecture of the 20th century. The entire structure is two-storeyed and shaped in the form of a crescent. It was carved from light brown sandstone blocks brought from Mirzapur, which in local language is known as “Chunar”. An enormous Gothic styled dome is positioned in the middle of this palatial structure. The facade of the dome is adorned with various images carved from sandstone. These play a huge part in making it visually appealing. The portico of Vidhan Bhawan, one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in Lucknow, consists of three archways topped by the state emblem which is carved in marble. The roof is also as beautiful as the dome, as it is decorated with numerous figures of dancing peacocks. The entrance hall is also marked on both sides by circular marble staircases. The arches on the lower part of the structure do well to lend it utmost grace and style.

An interesting attraction during a sightseeing tour in the city of Lucknow, is Hussainabad Clock Tower. Located near Rumi Darwaza, Husainabad Clock Tower was erected by Hussainabad Trust in the year 1881. The construction of this architectural marvel was started by Nawab Nasir-ud-din. Standing comfortably at a height of 221 ft, this imposing structure was built as a gesture to welcome of the first Lt. Gov of United Province of Awadh - Sir George Couper. Amidst the chaos of the citylife, this historical tourist attraction in Lucknow often referred to as Ghantaghar is tallest of its kind in India. The inside of this must-visit place in Lucknow is made up of gunmetal, which is a rare material used in the construction.
History
This 19th-century construction was aimed to be constructed as a replica of London’s BIG BEN Clock Tower. Therefore, the architecture of Hussainabad Clock Tower boasts a major influence of the Gothic and Victorian style of design. After being inoperative for 27 years, the clock of the tower was decided to be replaced in the year 2010 by the district administration of the region.
