Bara Imambara, built by Nawab of Awadh Asaf-ud-Daula, is one of the most important historical monuments in Lucknow. The Imambara complex consists of a baoli (stepwell) and a bhool bhulaiyya, a labyrinth with interconnected doorways. There are over 1024 ways to reach the terrace but only two ways to come back down. 
The pride and joy of a historical city that captivates the hearts of people near and far, Bara Imambara is a testament to the time and one of the top tourist destinations of Lucknow.
One of the most well-known buildings in the city is the Lucknow Bara Imambara. It is one of the most beautiful examples of Mughal architecture and a rightful triumph and ode to engineering.
Winding and a bizarre labyrinth of narrow passageways running through the upper floor of the monument are the true showstoppers. It is also known as the Bhool Bhulaiya passage.
This Bara Imambara is second in size only to the Nizamat Imambara.
The Bara Imambara was constructed using Gothic, Rajput, and Mughal architectural elements. It was created by one of the most respected architects, Hafiz Kifayat Ullah, and is an example of pure engineering brilliance beyond comparison.
It is one of the last prominent projects that does not employ iron or other European design components.
There are 9 halls inside the monument, with the largest being the central hall.
It is one of the largest arched structures in the world, measuring 50 X 16 meters and standing over 15 meters tall with no beams supporting the ceiling.
Its construction is distinctive because it contains no woodwork other than what is found in the galleries. The roof is supported only by the interlocking bricks used to assemble the blocks and stands erect without any pillars.
The Imamabara is made of Lakhauri bricks and is decorated with stucco work, chattris, and parapets. This Imambara is distinctive because its roof is constructed with rice husk ash.
Bara Imambara is locally famous for its amazing maze, also called Bhool Bhulaiya. The topmost floor of the monument's structure is filled with an alluring maze of little tunnels that eventually leads to the rooftop.
There are 1024 ways to enter the maze, but only two methods to exit it. One may have a comprehensive perspective of the city from the roof.
The construction of this magnificent structure was started in the year 1784 by Nawab Asaf-Ud-Daula, the fourth Nawab of Awadh. It took more than 14 years to finish. Bara Imambara's remarkable history captivates the attention of all tourists visiting this fascinating location.
The masterpiece results from Nawab's love and devotion for his people. When the Awadh region was severely affected by a disaster, increasing employment was the purpose of erecting this monument.
A catastrophic famine that hit the Awadh Estate in the 18th century prompted the Nawab to devise a strategy to feed his starving subjects. He decided to require them to build great structures, which would then give them work and, consequently, food.
More than 20,000 people—rich, poor, and elite—were employed by Asaf-ud-relief Daula's effort, which took 11 years to complete—exactly how long the famine lasted.
The working class and poor started the project in the morning, and all of the construction was destroyed in the evening by the upper class.
Every one was guaranteed to work and support themselves until conditions returned to normal in 1791.

Though some parts of this Kaiserbagh Palace have witnessed various damages, yet, it stands as one of the examples of the architectural brilliance in the city of Lucknow. The beautiful pavilions, imposing walls and age-old statues altogether take the charm of the palace to a different level.
History of Kaiserbagh Palace
The construction of Lucknow’s Kaiserbagh Palace is credited to Wajid Ali Shah, the successor of Muhammad Ali. Wazid Ali, known to be a connoisseur of art and architecture was known more for his pleasure pursuits than for his administrative capabilities. The Kaiserbagh Palace in Lucknow was built between 1848 and 1850. The Nawab expected the palace to be regarded as the eighth wonder of the world.
Architecture of Kaiserbagh Palace
This popular tourist attraction in Lucknow boasts stunning Mughal architecture. Erected in the 19th century, the palace incorporates Moorish minarets, lanterns, banisters, pediments, and ionic columns.

Constantania House is one of the most visited historical monuments in Lucknow. It was built using a blend of various architectural styles and influences. It is located on the campus of La Martiniere College and is a must-visit when in Lucknow.
Since the British period, Lucknow has been home to one of the finest schools and colleges in India. Even today, Lucknow acts as a hub of education and research with a number of premier educational institutions being located in and around the city. The capital city of Uttar Pradesh has enjoyed the privilege of being home to some highly reputed colleges and schools in India.
The La Martinière College finds a place among the most eagerly sought institutions of the city that provide secondary education. The college was founded in conformity with the will of General Claude Martin, who was born in Lyon, France, in the year 1735.
The founder of La Martinière College, Claude Martin was an officer in the British army in India, who died in Lucknow in 1800. He left a will according to his which, some funds were allocated for the development of schools in Lyon, Calcutta and Lucknow. He also mentioned that his house at Constantia House, college building and the adjoining ground should never be sold or auctioned. The purpose of Claude Martin’s will was to preserve the Constantia House for imparting English education to young men. The day of the death of General Claude Martin is remembered and celebrated as “Founders Day” in La Martinière College every year.
The Founder – Claude Martin
The La Martinière Boys College was established by a donation from the affluent 18th century Frenchman, Major General Claude Martin. He was a Major in the French Army, who later joined the East India Company’s Bengal Army.
The General is said to have acquired most of his wealth from his ventures while serving at Lucknow under Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula of Awadh. He was considered the richest Frenchman during that time in India. The palatial Constantia House, which now accommodates the famous La Martinière College, was constructed in 1785 as the general’s residence on the extreme east end of Lucknow city. However, the Mansion of Constantia could not be completed until 1802. Unfortunately, Claude Martin died on 13th September, 1800, before Constantia House could be completed.
Many historians are of the opinion that the house of Claude Martin took its name from the college’s motto Labore et Constantia. There are other historians, who put forward an unconfirmed view that the complex was named after a young French girl Constance, who many think was Claude Martin’s first love.
It is generally believed that Claude Martin was driven not just by pride but by an aspiration to protect his personal property and belongings even after his death. He did not want his family members or friends to inherit his personal belongings or property after his death. According to his will, he wanted himself to be buried under Constantia House as he feared that the structure might be desecrated after his death. Claude Martin was buried in a specially-made cellar in the basement of Constantia House.
Hence, Constantia House became both a mausoleum and a college. It is considered to be the largest European funereal memorial in India. Famous historian and poet William Dalrymple has even described it as British East India Company’s apt answer to the colossal Taj Mahal.
The Early Years of La Martinière
After the death of Claude Martin, there were prolonged legal disputes in the court regarding his will. The will of Martin was proved only in 1840 in the Calcutta High Court. In the meantime, the building was utilized as a guesthouse for foreign dignitaries and visiting officials.
The college was opened on 1st October, 1845 with just 70 boys. Mr. John Newmarch was the first principal of La Martinière College. Initially, only Eurasians and Europeans were allowed to get their boys enrolled in the college. Unlike the Calcutta branch, the Constantia House of Lucknow was officially established outside the East India Company’s area, hence its interaction with the local population was frequent.
La Martinière during the Mutiny of 1857
The Mutiny of 1857 in Lucknow saw military events at the La Martinière campus. The East India Company called the students of La Martinière College to help the British troops to help defend the British Residency in Lucknow. The names of 67 boys and 8 staff members, who were a part of the plan, are engraved on the Roll of Honor at La Martinière Lucknow.
The rebellion started on 30th June, 1857 and Sir Henry Lawrence instructed the evacuation of La Martinière. Several school boys used to travel from the British Residency to their college gathering military provisions. The military force within the British Residency comprised British and Indian soldiers and even civil volunteers including quite a few Anglo Indians.
The Martinière group of boys was headed by Mr. George Schilling, who was the principal of the college. The Residency in Lucknow was under attack for 86 days, until it was freed by Sir Colin Campbell in the month of November 1857.
The Present State of La Martinière College
La Martinière is a premier boy’s college situated in Lucknow. The college is affiliated to ICSE Board and is high on the list of schools that parents’ want to get their boys enrolled into. The marvelous French architecture of the colossal monument and its glorious past has added to the charm of the college among the city residents. The Constantia has perfectly stood the test of time to be home to one of the leading schools in North India even after  more than 150 years of its establishment.
The city people still prefer to address the Constantia as Martin Saheb Ki Kothi (Bunglow of Claude Martin) in Martin Purwa area, beyond Bandariya Bagh. The building is unquestionably one of the most outstanding European structures of the city. It is well preserved and is efficiently being handled by the college administration. The former principals, administrators and teachers, not to forget the current administration, deserve accolades for their sincere efforts in the preservation and maintaining the rich legacy of the Constantia.
Dilkusha Kothi was built in the 18th century in the English Baroque style of architecture and is one of the most popular historical places in Lucknow. Not much remains of the structure but a few towers and the external walls of the monument. The surrounding garden adds to the beauty and old-world charm of the monnument.  
If there is one thing that Lucknow stands out for, it is its regal and royal aura. There is a touch of richness from the monuments to the cuisine.
The magnificent and extraordinary Dilkusha Palace is located in the cantonment area of Lucknow, to the northeast of Raj Bhavan.
You can see the ruins of a mansion constructed in the English baroque style in the eighteenth century near Dilkusha Kothi. Even though it is now in ruins, the remnants are a clear testament to its erstwhile artistic beauty and excellent architecture.
It still has a regal air to show it is a building with a lot of historical and cultural value. Some of the most exciting moments in Indian history have taken place there. It is one of Lucknow's lesser-known historical sites and one of the top tourist attractions of Lucknow.
Dilkusha Kothi, often referred to as the English house or Vilayati Kothi, was constructed during the rule of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan.
Architecture of Dilkusha Kothi
One of Lucknow's most magnificent monuments, the Dilkusha Kothi, is built in the Baroque architectural style. It is close to the Lucknow cantonment area in the NER colony.
You'll observe that the building lacks a courtyard, which is strange because that was quite uncommon during those times. Additionally, the Delaval Hall of Seaton bears a striking resemblance to the design.
The Dilkusha Kothi's main structure is located on the western section of the north-south axis. This was made specifically for the Nawab. It was a palace that the Nawab held dear, which is why it was given the name "Dil Kusha," which translates to "happy heart."
William Howard Russell, a renowned Times journalist, reported that Lucknow was the most beautiful City he had ever seen and that it was more lovely than Rome, Athens, and Constantinople.
It is built on a higher platform facing west, which can only be comprehended by looking at the bastions surrounding it. Additionally, the ruins show that the guard room was one of a series of small chambers on one side.
The building's roof was entirely demolished during the conflict in 1857, further damaging the eastern side and ruining the brilliant architectural design. The Palace has been repaired, thanks to the Government and the Archeological Survey of India.
Mary Linley Taylor, a British actress who lives in Seoul, South Korea's Jongno neighborhood, decided to name her home "Dilkusha" after her visit to the Dilkusha Kothi.
Another mansion with outstanding architecture and an Indo-European design is located northeast of this structure. The two-story castle is constructed with lime mortar and Lakhauri bricks.
It looks gorgeous with the white plaster all over it. Given that the location was enveloped with thick jungles and deadly wild animals, the palaces served as hunting lodges and vacation resorts.
History behind Dilkusha Kothi
Major Gore Ouseley, a British resident and close friend of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan, the then-ruler of Oudh, created the Dilkusha Kothi in the 18th century. Although it also operated as a summer resort, it was initially constructed as a hunting lodge for the Nawabs.
The Dilkusha Kothi, now one of the top sightseeing spots in Lucknow, was once utilized by the Begums (wives of Nawabs) as a location to unwind, rest, and take picnics because of its proximity to the river. This location lacked a separate zenana (women's room), a characteristic of all Nawabi structures, which is noteworthy.
The structure underwent additional modifications during the reign of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. He was the tenth and last Nawab of Awadh. During the early years of his administration, he was the one who constructed another Kothi just next to it. He did this so that he could organize military drills for his soldiers.
The British, extremely upset by this act, commanded him to cease all further drills. The Nawab felt pretty upset and helpless as a result. He was compelled to resign by the British not long after that. He was unlawfully removed from office due to his refusal to sign his abdication statement before doing so.
But during the siege of Lucknow, the Palace was destroyed, and gunshot holes could be seen on every wall, a loud reminder of the courageous freedom fighters' sacrifice. With the aid of British troops, Sir Colin Campbell, the Commander-in-Chief at the time, seized control of the Palace in November 1857.
How Dilkusha Kothi stands today
The structure suffered considerably after the siege of Lucknow in 1857 and was destroyed by the 1880s. The Indian Archaeological Survey has been working on its restoration for several years.
In the current situation, Dilkusha Kothi is a destroyed palace surrounded by large yet constrained Dilkusha Gardens. The large gardens are still present, although the monument consists of a few towers and external walls. In addition, a magnificent mansion northeast of this structure was constructed in the Indo-European style.
Even if there aren't many people around in the summer, things are very different in the winter. Numerous tourists from various countries travel there to visit the location. Many people, including children and teenagers, view this as a great picnic location where they spend the entire day with friends and family.
This location is surrounded by history, nature, and peace and is ideal for reflective conversations. Despite being close to the busy Charbagh railway station, this location is serene, especially in the winter.
You can't help but be moved by the sight of the Dilkusha Kothi and the events that took place here when you see it now. It appears as though the building is lamenting the sacrifices and lives lost. The air is heavy with nothingness, and nostalgia overtakes you in the midst of it all.
Entry fee and timings of Dilkusha Kothi

Tomb of Saadat Ali Khan,One of the most popular Nawabs of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, and his wife Khurshid Zadi rest in peace in this tomb. The intricate architecture and the beautiful garden around the tomb attract many visitors to this historical site.Not-so-lofty in size yet renowned for it’s brilliant artistry, Maqbara of Saadat Ali Khan is one-such famous landmark of the city. Situated near Begum Hazrat Mahal Park, this beautifully designed structure was built by Nawab Ghazi-ud-Din Haider and was meant to serve as a mausoleum for his father Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. Nawab Saadat Ali Khan’s Maqbara is built in the Indo-Islamic style of architecture. The walls of the facade has fine stucco work done on it. It also has turrets and a huge dome which is further embellished with an inverted guldasta over it. Atop the guldasta is fixed a pointed, narrow rod which aims at the sky. The building has it’s floor chequered with black and white marbles and it’s walls adorned with several arched doors and windows. ‘Lakhauri bricks and locally available mortar was used to build this structure. Had this Maqbara been built with white marble, it would have transcended the beauty of Taj Mahal’, states the famous historian, Mr. Roshan Taqui. Just like Asifi Masjid, initially this Maqbara had rooms at the base of it. But it was later when they were closed permanently. The tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan’s wife Murshidzaadi lies adjacent to his Maqbara.
It was in the year 1814 when Nawab Saadat Ali Khan died and his son Ghazi-ud-Din Haider came to the throne, shifting from his previous residence to Chhatar Manzil, which once used to be his father’s palace. Nawab Ghazi-ud-Din Haider was overwhelmed to take over his father’s palace and he felt that it was now his duty to do something for him. So he decided to dismantle his previous residence and get his father’s mausoleum built on the same land. Since then, this well-favored edifice houses the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. It was built in the area which was then called Khas Bazaar and is presently known as Qaiser Bagh. Khas Bazaar served as a market for the VIP’s, royal families and their foreign visitors. It’s really disheartening to see the present state of such a wondrous monument. It’s deteriorating condition in the form of crumbling plasters, broken pointed rod at it’s peak, dull-blackened walls and bad shape of the park surrounding it, is awaiting for the onlookers’s to pay heed over the feeling of love and respect with which it was once built and help it in regaining it’s original grace.
The tombs of Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi are grand in their own right, and visiting them can be a delightful experience. Both these tombs, which are one of the popular tourist attractions in Lucknow, are known for their intricate architecture and the garden surrounding them. Located in close proximity to the Begum Hazrat Mahal Park (built in 1962 to commemorate her contribution to the revolt of 1857), the tomb houses the 5th Nawab of Awadh, Saadat Ali Khan, and his wife, Khurshid Zadi. She was the favourite wife of the Nawab and died during his lifetime. Saadat Ali Khan was the ruler of Awadh from 1794-1814 AD, and many of the heritage buildings dotting the area between Qaisar Bagh and Dilkusha can be credited to him. During this time, the British ruled large parts of Lucknow and were becoming more powerful with each passing day. It is quite easy to overlook this wonderful memorial amidst other heritage buildings in the city like Chota Imambara and Bara Imambara. However, it is only upon visiting the tombs that you find out what you were missing out on.
Architecture
The tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan and Khurshid Zadi are counted among the best places to visit in Lucknow. Their architecture has a lot to do with that. While its facade is decorated with lime plaster, the walls are built using Lakhuri bricks (red colored burnt clay bricks) while sandstone has been used for the floors. Upon entering the tomb, you come across rectangular verandahs with intricately carved arched doorways. Of these, those on the southern and eastern side contain the graves of the daughters and wives of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan. The floor of the tomb has also been given an elegant look, thanks to the black and white marble tiles laid out in a chess like pattern. Among the other features of the tomb, its hemispherical dome deserves a special mention. It attracts the attention of the onlookers with its symmetrical shape and is topped by an inverted lotus and a finial. In the center of the hall, there is an elegant rectangular design which marks the exact place where the tomb of Nawab Saadat Ali Khan rests. Head towards the basement and you come across three graves, one of the Nawab and the other two of his brothers.
The tomb of Khurshid Zadi is located to the east of the Nawab’s tomb. Although it is a four level structure, the graves of the mother and daughter rest at the lowest level. On the corners of the domes are octagonal shaped chhatris, which embellish its beauty. The tombs, which make for great sightseeing in Lucknow, are surrounded by beautiful gardens and are great for enjoying some moments of peace and solitude.
