This place defines Lucknow food in so many ways. Whoever visits this place, cannot forget the taste of these uniquely spiced kebabs for a very long time. The meat tends to dissolve in the mouth instantly and is best complimented with roomali rotis. The Chowk outlet serves only beef kebabs while the Aminabad outlet serves both mutton and beef kebabs at a very cheap price. So eat as much as you want without burning a hole in your pocket!
